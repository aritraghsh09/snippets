This is meant to be a personal collection of python routines (both for plotting &amp; general data analysis) that I use pretty frequently.

Curvefit --> Python routine for fitting a curve using Scipy's curvefit

Matplotlib --> Collection of different plotting scripts which use Pythons Matplotlib

MCMC --> A very simple implementation of MCMC(Metropolis) on Supernova Data

Progress Bar --> A simple progress bar to add to those pesky long runs!
